<div class="note-card">
  <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>

  <p>I am applying for the <strong>ASP.NET Developer (UI Expert)</strong> role, bringing over 15 years of professional experience in frontend and enterprise web development, including more than six years working extensively with <em>ASP.NET MVC</em>, C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

  <p>In my previous roles, I led frontend development for large-scale retail and enterprise systems, building complex dashboards, CRUD-heavy admin platforms, and real-time reporting interfaces used across multiple locations. I specialize in hand-coded, responsive UI development—crafting clean layouts, optimizing performance, and ensuring cross-device consistency without over-reliance on frameworks.</p>

  <p>Beyond ASP.NET MVC, I've worked across modern stacks (React, TypeScript, automation-driven systems), demonstrating strong adaptability and the ability to quickly ramp up on new technologies such as Blazor. I collaborate closely with backend teams to integrate APIs and server-side logic into seamless user experiences, always prioritizing scalability, maintainability, and production stability.</p>

  <p>I am comfortable working in fast-paced startup environments, communicating clearly in English, and I am fully available for daily collaboration between <strong>7:00 AM and 9:00 AM EST</strong>.</p>

  <p>I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my UI expertise and enterprise-level ASP.NET experience to your team.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br />
  Peter S. Madale<br />
